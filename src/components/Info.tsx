                The Core Modules are the heart & soul of this new programme.

                During the Core Modules taken, trainees work with their trainers to identify areas of particular strength. Trainers use these insights, along with a view of upcoming roles, to create discipline ‘pods’. Each pod work separately on selected modules to enhance their insight into key aspects of that discipline area before coming back together to share & apply their skills in a multi-disciplinary project.
